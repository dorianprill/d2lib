toy project for learning rust & reverse engineering.
goals:
  - read network packages from one of my favorite games ever, and track the needed game state in own data structures.  
  - enable safe packet injection
  - priority based event handling for modules (e.g. move, combat, pick, chicken)
  - reveal game maps by generating own version from game seed  
  - infer play-styles for characters builds or allow scripting

disclaimer: none of this works yet and none of it probably ever will work. it's just a haxercise :)
heavily inspired by an old [client-less C# bot by dkuwahara](https://github.com/dkuwahara/OmegaBot) and a [blog post by Eric Carmichael](http://www.ericcarmichael.com/my-diablo-2-botting-phase.html)
